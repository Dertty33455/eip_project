# BookShell Monorepo

This workspace has been reorganised into two top-level directories:

- `frontend/` – the Next.js 14 application (user interface and built-in API routes).
- `backend/` – a standalone Laravel 12 service providing the same REST API.

For details on the frontend code, see `frontend/README.md`.
For backend setup instructions, see `backend/README.md`.
